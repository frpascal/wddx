     Introductory Notes:
 
 
     What is WDDX:
 
     WDDX stands for Web Distributed Data Exchange. WDDX is a mechanism for
     exchanging complex data structures between application environments. It
     has been designed with web applications in mind. WDDX consists of a 
     language and platform neutral representation of instantiated data based
     on XML 1.0 (which is defined using this DTD) and a set of serializer/
     deserializer modules for every environment that uses WDDX. The process 
     of creating an XML representation of application data is called
     serialization. The process of instantiating application data from a 
     WDDX XML representation is called deserialization.
 
     WDDX packets:
 
     The WDDX DTD can be used to validate WDDX packets. Packets are
     representations of instantiated data structures in application 
     environments. The following is an example of a WDDX packet:
 
         <?xml version='1.0'?>
         <!DOCTYPE wddxPacket SYSTEM 'wddx_0100.dtd'>
         <wddxPacket version='1.0'>

     It defines a root level object that is a structure (also known as 
     an associative array) of eight properties:
 
     - aNull which is a null value,
     - aString which is the string 'a string',
     - aNumber which is the number -12.456,
     - aDateTime which is the date-time value June 12, 1998 4:32:12am,
     - aBoolean which is the boolean value true,
     - anArray which is an array of two elements (10 and 'second element'),
     - aBinary which contains 8 bytes of binary data encoded in base64,
     - anObject which is a structure with two properties s and n, and
     - aRecordset which is a recordset of two rows with fields NAME and AGE.
          
     Basic data types:
     
     WDDX supports the following basic data types: null, boolean (true/false), 
     number, date-time, and string. 
     
     Null-
     Null values in WDDX are not associated with a type such as number or 
     string. Languages that do not have the concept of a null value should
     deserialize nulls as empty strings.
 
     Numbers-
     Numbers are internally represented with floating point numbers. Because 
     of differences between WDDX-enabled languages, the range of numbers has 
     been restricted to +/-1.7E+/-308. The precision has been restricted to 
     15 digits after the decimal point. These requirements are consistent 
     with an 8-byte floating-point representation.
 
     Date-time values-
     Date-time values are encoded according to the full form of ISO8601,
     e.g., 1998-9-15T09:05:32+4:0. Note that single-digit values for months,
     days, hours, minutes, or seconds do not need to be zero-prefixed. 
     While timezone information is optional, it must be successfully parsed
     and used to convert to local date-time values. Efforts should me made 
     to ensure that the internal representation of date-time values does not 
     suffer from Y2K problems and covers a sufficient range of dates. In 
     particular, years must always be represented with four digits.
 
     Strings-
     Strings can be of arbitrary length and must not contain embedded nulls.
     To facilitate the inclusion of control characters in strings, the
     <string> element can contain <char code='??'/> elements. The value of
     the code attribute is a two-character representation of the UTF-8 hex 
     code for a given control character. For example, <char code='0C'/>
     represents the form feed character. Control characters are characters
     in the UTF-8 range 00-1F. Note that tab (09) and newline (0A) characters
     can be included directly in XML text. The XML 1.0 specification Section
     2.11 requires XML processors to not pass carriage return (0D) characters
     to applications. 
     
     Note on end-of-line handling-
     End-of-line characters have platform and programming language specific 
     representations. Different application environments may use either a 
     single newline (0A), a single carriage return (0D), or a carriage return 
     and newline combination (0D0A). For the purposes of successful data 
     encoding and translation the elements <char code='0A'/> and 
     <char code='0D'/> must be used to encode newline and carriage return 
     characters when they should be preserved in the deserialized string. 
     Note that Section 2.11 of the XML 1.0 specification requires XML 
     processors to translate all occurrences of carriage returns and the 
     carriage return, newline combination to a single newline character. 
     Therefore, for the purposes of XML, end-of-line is represented by a 
     single newline character.
 
     Complex data types:
 
     WDDX supports the following complex data types: arrays, structures,
     recordsets, and binary.
 
     Arrays-
     Arrays are integer-indexed collections of objects of arbitrary type. 
     The starting index value is usually 0 with the notable exception of 
     CFML whose arrays have an initial index value of 1. Because of these
     differences working with array indices can lead to non-portable data.
 
     Structures-
     Structures are string-indexed collections of objects of arbitrary type.
     In many languages they are known as associative arrays, dictionaries, or
     maps. Structures contain one or more variables. Because some of the 
     languages supported by WDDX are not case-sensitive, no two variable names
     can differ only by their case. In the case where two variables have the 
     same names or differ only by their case the final deserialized value would
     be the value of the last variable.
 
     Recordsets-
     Recordsets are tabular data encapsulations: a set of named fields with 
     the same number of rows of data. Only simple data types can be stored in
     recordsets. For tabular data storage of complex data types, an array of 
     structures should be used. Because some of the languages supported by WDDX
     are not case-sensitive, no two field names can differ only by their case.
     In the case where two fields have the same names or differ only by their
     case the final deserialized values will be the values from the last field. 
     Field names must satisfy the regular expression [_A-Za-z][_.0-9A-Za-z]* 
     where the '.' stands for a period, not 'any character'.
 
     Binary-
     The binary datatype represents strings (blobs) of binary data. The WDDX 
     DTD allows for multiple encodings of binary data. In this version only 
     MIME style base64 encoding is supported by the specification. Optionally,
     the length of the encoded binary object can be provided as a hint to
     WDDX deserializers. It can be used to validate the length of the binary
     object after decoding. It can also be used for efficient allocation of
     memory during the decoding process.
 
     Data type comparisons:
 
     The following table compares the basic WDDX data types with those of 
     languages/technologies/specifications commonly used on the Web.

     More on data types:
 
     Reserved properties-
     For the purposes of efficiently implementing WDDX platform modules in
     a variety of languages, and to facilitate the representation of
     arbitrary datatypes, WDDX reserves all object/structure/recordset
     property/var/field names beginning with '_wddx'. (The prefix is case-
     insensitive because some of the languages WDDX works with are case-
     insensitive.) WDDX serializers can treat such names in a special, 
     language and platform specific manner. WDDX deserializers can do the 
     same with the name attributes of the var and field elements.
     
     Serialization model-
     WDDX serializes data using a model of pure aggregation. It has no 
     mechanism for handling object references. Aliased references will result
     in multiple object instances being deserialized. WDDX serialization 
     applied to a data structure that has cyclical references will most 
     likely result in infinite iteration/recursion, depending on the 
     serializer implementation. Object references support is another area of 
     future investigation.
 
     Multiple object types-
     WDDX provides no built-in mechanism for representing objects of 
     arbitrary type. This is done on purpose to enable interoperability
     between application environments using a minimal yet functional set of
     datatypes. In some special cases, however, particularly when WDDX is 
     used to exchange data between identical application environments, there
     is a need for preserving object type in the serialization/
     deserialization process. To facilitate this, the top-level elements
     representing all datatypes can have an optional 'type' attribute whose 
     value is platform-specific. Upon serialization this attribute can be 
     used to provide information about the type of the serialized object. If
     provided, the value of this attribute can be used by a deserializer to 
     instantiate a particular type of object. To facilitate the 
     representation of arbitrary objects the _wddx_structAttributes_type 
     property is reserved to contain the value of the type attribute of the 
     struct element. Neither sererializers nor deserializers are required to
     use or populate this reserved property, but it is recommended that they
     provide the capability. However, if they do provide it, it is required 
     (on both sides) that this behavior is optional and that it defaults to 
     "Off".
     
     DTD verbosity:
 
     This DTD is purposefully made verbose to aid the readability of WDDX
     packets. If packet size becomes an issue, compressing WDDX packets
     using an HTTP-safe real time compression algorithm is likely to be a
     much more appropriate solution than, for example, a DTD that uses one
     character element and attribute names. Some experiments conducted at
     Allaire suggest that 5 - 15 fold compression rates are achievable.
